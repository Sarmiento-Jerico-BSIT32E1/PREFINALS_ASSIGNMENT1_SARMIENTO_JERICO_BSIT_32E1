## Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
### Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

### Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?

### Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

###Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:

### 1.Benefits: (1-3 keywords) Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

### Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

### Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

### MVC: Components: (1-3 keywords each)

### Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

### Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)

### Web API: ## Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

### Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

### Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
